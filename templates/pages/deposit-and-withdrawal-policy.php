     <p id="u5964-2">Trading in any investment opportunity that may generate profit requires Golden Eye Capitals customers to deposit money on their online account. Profits may be withdrawn from the online account.</p>

       <p id="u5964-2">Deposits and withdrawals are regulated by this WD policy as well as the generally applicable terms and conditions.</p>

If you want to start trading, you should make sure this account is in your country of residence and in your name. In order to certify that a SWIFT confirmation is authentic, it has to be sent to Golden Eye Capitals to confirm the origin of the money which will be used for trading. If you don’t comply with this WD policy, you may be prevented from depositing the money via Bank/Wire Transfer. Please allow up to 5 business days for the deposited funds via Bank/Wire Transfer to appear on your trading account. If you did not login and traded from your account within six (6) months (“Dormant Account”), your Dormant Account will be subject to a deduction of 10 % each month (the “Dormant Fee”).</p>
